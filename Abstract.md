The presented research work aims to build a robotic arm whose task is to sort cubes based on colour. 
In the presented work, the following topics were addressed: study of algorithms, construction of the robotic arm, control of the robot to succeed in the required tasks and testing of the robot.
In the study of algorithms the chosen method was presented, that is the calculation of direct kinematics.
The calculation of homogeneous transformation matrices for each coupling was performed using the MatLab program. 
The next step was to test the obtained results , and after they were checked if they meet the necessary requirements. 
During the testing of the robotic arm , it was subjected to several tests to check if the robotic arm has the desired behaviour in several situations.
Finally, in the research paper several aspects were presented, those being: the construction of the robot, the hardware and software implementation of an autonomous robotic arm responsible for sorting cubes of different colours.
